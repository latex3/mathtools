Announcement release 202x/xx/xx

For mathtools.dtx v1.30

* Added a caveat about \xmapsto when ever unicode-math is loaded. The
  macro does not work as the symbol marking the bar at the start is
  not available under unicode-math. (#45)
* Added a default \MT_active_colon_false for when centercolon=true has
  never been executed (#49)


Announcement release 2022/06/29

For mathtools.dtx v1.29

* In section `Special mathtools options` clearified when `gathered` of pure amsmath might give a warning. (#38)
* Added 3.6 note 3: about \section{foo $\norm[\big]{bar}$}.
* Renamed a few colon combo symbols and added a few extra for completeness. (#44)
  A package option is available to revert the change.
* Added a warning if mathtools is loaded *after* `unicode-math` (#43)


For mathtools.dtx v1.28a:

* fixed year typo in \ProvidesPackage


Announcement release 2022/02/02

For mathtools.dtx v1.28:

* added note about \eqref and showonlyrefs (#33)
* fixed typo in note about strange 3-arg \bracket command (#34)
* fixed typo in section 3.4.4 (strange \hphantom{g}) (#32)
* removed robustifying \(\)\[\], it is now in the LaTeX kernel (#30)
* added \xlongrightarrow and \xlongleftarrow (#12)
* added \MakeAboxedCommand to generate \Aboxed like macros (#32)

Announcement release 2021/04/12

For mathtools.dtx v1.27:

* fixed issue #25: Two typos in \MultlinedHook.


Announcement release 2021/03/28

For mathtools.dtx v1.26:

* LuaLaTeX has cramped primitives build in. We ought to use those when LuaLaTeX is used.
  LuaLaTeX brances added,  fixing issue #24.
  Special thanks to Marcel Kr√ºger, Ulrike Fischer and Philipp Stephani.

Announcement release 2021/03/18

For mathtools.dtx v1.25:

* fixed issue #18, thanks to Ruixi Zhang
* fixed issue #20 (via https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/252412/3929)
* fixed issue #22 
* fixed issue #21, suggestions for documentation by Rimole.
* fixed issue #19
* fixed issue #17, thanks to Ruixi Zhang and David Carlisle


For mhsetup.dtx v1.4:

* fixed issue #15 by adding \MH_group_align_safe_begin/end: to
  \MH_nospace_ifnextchar:Nnn. That way it should also work in tested
  alignments. Solution provided by Phelype Oleinik


Announcement release 2020/03/24

* mathtools and empheq is now hosted at https://github.com/latex3/mathtools 
  
* Additional ideas for math will now be added to mathtools as amsmath might not
  be the right home for them at the moment.
  
* cleared up some documentation (reported by Frank Mittelbach,, issue #1)

* Explained a bit about nested \splitfrac and their need to be added
  \mathstrut (reported by Frank Mittelbach, issue #2)

* added spaces to the arguments of \xLeftarrow, \xRightarrow and
  \xLeftrightarrow moving the arguments away from the large arrow
  head(s) (suggested by Frank Mittelbach, issue #3)

* added \xmathstrut an adjustable extention to the normal \mathstrut (issue #4)

* empheq: fixed several issues related to amsart/-book plus a few others
  (issues #5, #6 and #8)


Announcement release 2020/01/17

* a few typos in the manual (from  Mike Dworski)
* added \kern1sp in a few places related to showonlyrefs preventing
  equation to add extra blank lines. This fixes both
  https://tex.stackexchange.com/q/524598/3929 and
  https://tex.stackexchange.com/q/257928/3929 


Announcement release 2019/07/31

* fixed typo in manual (\Prop vs \Prob, reported by Shapour Madadpour)
* added \crampedsubstack and cramedsubarray (suggested by Henri Menke).
* added multlined hook fixes for smallmatrix and the smallmatrix variants we provide.


Announcement release 2018/01/08

* Fixed typo in \intertext, the interface for specifying the space
  above and below now works as advertised.


Announcement release 2017/10/30

* fixed \null\, bug in (l|r|)gathered versions, bringing it in line with amsmath
  Reported in https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/397718/3929


Announcement release 2017

* changed amsmath requirelemnt to 2016/11/05 (in order to use the aligend fix)

* Applied the amsmath aligned fix to multlined, now the left part aligned correctly
  Reported by campa in a note to <https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/369212/3929>

* Reimplemented `\DeclarePairedDelimiter` and friends to fix the following problem:

		\mathclose{\rvert}^2 vs \mathclose\rvert^2

	They might not give the same result (depending on the font
    setup). Thus the internal wrappers need to be changed into three
    branches: star, nostarnonscaled, nostarscaled, where the
    difference between the last two is whether or not braces are
    applied to the fences.

	This problem was reported in <https://tex.stackexchange.com/q/364308/3929>

* Since we were cleaning up `\DeclarePairedDelimiter` and friends,
  `\DeclarePairedDelimiterX` is now implemented as a call to `\DeclarePairedDelimiterXPP`
  with empty pre- and postcode.

* The \DeclarePairedDelimiter(X,XPP) reimplementation removes a grouping issue reported in
  <https://tex.stackexchange.com/q/366665/3929>

* since there is no longer any `nostar` wrapper branch, redeclaring the `nostar` wrapper
  will now give an error.

* Removed `-\jot` from the multlined implementation (invisible line). Issue reported in at
  least <http://tex.stackexchange.com/a/258162/3929> and
  <https://tex.stackexchange.com/q/369156/3929>. It is not 100% correct, but better than
  with `-\jot`.

* fixed bug in empheq in relation to AMS clases

* renamed macros in mhsetup, mathtools and empheq such that any xxx_yyy: macro should now
  contain EQ, MH or HT as a prefix or infix. Thus making everyting truely separate from
  expl3 defined syntax.

* changed \shortintertext such that as long as 'original-intertext=false' (the default), 
  \shortintertext now only work in the same context as \intertext

* \shortintertext is now also an error inside the empheq construction

* sporadic space fixed in \noeqref, reported by Christian Vetter (private email)

* Added \ignorespaces after \noindent, bug inherited from amsmath
